# K12-PentTest

This project will conduct a series of authorized penetration tests / vulnerability assessments against a range of different schools. Through asset enumeration, vulnerability detection, and potentially  even social engineering results, it is my hope to document some specifics around scope and scale of Cybersecurity opportunities for the industry while at the same time providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations for individual schools.
